![Apache Spark](images/apache-spark.png)

[Apache Spark™](https://spark.apache.org/) is a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning on single-node machines or clusters

## Apache Spark features

- Batch/streaming data: Unify the processing of your data in batches and real-time streaming, using your preferred language: Python, SQL, Scala, Java or R.
- SQL analytics: Execute fast, distributed ANSI SQL queries for dashboarding and ad-hoc reporting. Runs faster than most data warehouses. Apache Spark™ is built on an advanced distributed SQL engine for large-scale data.
- Machine learning: Train machine learning algorithms on a laptop and use the same code to scale to fault-tolerant clusters of thousands of machines.
- Data science at scale: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on petabyte-scale data without having to resort to downsampling
